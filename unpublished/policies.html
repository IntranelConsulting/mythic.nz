    <h3>Analytics</h3>

    <h4>Hotjar</h4>

    <p>
      We use <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotjar</a> to help understand
      how you and our members use Mythic. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our members'
      experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what they do and don’t
      like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with member feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and
      other technologies to collect data on our members’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address
      (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device
      identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display
      our website. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually
      forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.
    </p>

    <p>
      For further details, please see the "<a
        href="https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/categories/115001323967-About-Hotjar"

      >" section of Hotjar’s support site.
    </p>

    <h4>Matomo</h4>
    <p>
      Along with Hotjar, our primary source of analytics is
      <a href="https://matomo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matomo Analytics</a>. Because we self-host
      the software, no data is sent to Matomo. We have disabled tracking cookies and will respect Do Not Track signals
      from your browser. When you visit Mythic, we will collect and store: the website from which you visited us, the
      parts of Mythic you visit, the date and duration of your visit, your truncated and anonymised IP address, and
      information from the device (device type, operating system, screen resolution, language, country you are located
      in, and web browser type) you used during your visit. We process this usage data in Matomo Analytics for
      statistical purposes, to improve Mythic and to recognize and stop any misuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Page URLs containing storybook, folder, and page titles are all anonymised before being processed meaning that
      none of your content is captured in the analytics software.
    </p>
    <p>We do not sell or provide third-parties with our analytics data.</p>
    <!--
                Note: This will be added when we remove Hotjar in the future
                <p>In addition we use Matomo to produce heatmaps of aggregated (not individual) visits on Mythic. This
                information helps us create better a better experience for members as well as discover issues with the
                app. All member generated content is masked for both your privacy and intellectual property rights.</p>-->
