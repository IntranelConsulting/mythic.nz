# Privacy Policy

_Updated 1-July-2021 for public beta launch_

This policy is for **mythic.nz**, the informational site, specifically. It is different from [the policy and terms of service](https://app.mythic.nz/policies) for the tool itself, **app.mythic.nz**.

## Cookies

We don't use cookies.

## Analytics

### Matomo

We use Matomo Analytics to inform how our site is used. Because we self-host the software, no data is sent to the Matomo organisation. We have disabled tracking cookies and will respect Do Not Track signals from your browser. When you visit Mythic, we will collect and store: the website from which you visited us, the parts of Mythic you visit, the date and duration of your visit, your IP address (truncated and anonymised), and information from the device (device type, operating system, screen resolution, language, country you are located in, and web browser type) you used during your visit. We process this usage data in Matomo Analytics for statistical purposes, to improve Mythic, and to recognize and stop any misuse.

We do not sell or provide third-parties with our analytics data.

## Previous Policy

This was the policy on the initial announcement site for the closed beta. It still dictates our use of information collected in that time.

_Updated 14-Jan-2021 with details about emailing regarding Mythic's public release._

1. We don't use cookies.
2. If you decide to give us your email address, we will only use it to send you information about our beta program or the public release.
   1. If you want us to remove your email address from our database, [contact us at contact@mythic.nz](mailto:contact@mythic.nz) from that address.

That's it, that's the policy.
