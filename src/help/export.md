## Export Your Storybooks from Mythic

Find the Storybook you want to export in the Mythic Dashboard, and click the "Settings" button in the bottom right corner to open the settings modal.

<figure>
    {% image "./src/assets/help/export/settings.png", "Open the Settings modal to export your content", ["588px"], images.sizes.help, "" %}
    <figcaption>Click "Settings" to open the settings modal.</figcaption>
</figure>

In the "Export" section you will see two checkboxesâ€”use these to select what you would like to download.

<figure>
     {% image "./src/assets/help/export/export.png", "Export Options in the Settings modal", ["603px"], images.sizes.help, "" %}
    <figcaption>Choose what you would like to include in your export Zip.</figcaption>
</figure>

You can export your Storybook content as Markdown files (nested in the same folder structure you set up using the editor), and optionally include images used in your storybook. Whatever you choose to export will be downloaded as a `.zip` file which you will need to extract or unpack in order to view and use your content.

### Known Issues

- Links between pages may not always work and you will manually need to update these.
- If you decide to not download images with the Storybook, images uploaded to Mythic will not link correctly.
