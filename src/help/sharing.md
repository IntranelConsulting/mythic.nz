## Content Sharing

Storybooks and (soon) individual pages on Mythic can be shared with other people on the platform or the general public. Having Storybooks shared with you is an opt-in feature. Shared content is read-only, with collaborative features coming later. Here's how to use it.

### Storybook Sharing

Storybooks can be shared from the settings modal which you can access from the dashboard or the editor. You need to know the email address for the Mythic account you want to share your Storybook with. If the person has enabled sharing, the Storybook will appear on their dashboard, with your email address listed as the owner. You can share with multiple accounts and remove accounts at any time.

    {% image "./src/assets/help/sharing/sharing-modal.png", "Storybook settings modal", ["588px"], images.sizes.help, "" %}
    <figcaption>Click "Settings" to open the settings modal.</figcaption>
</figure>

Additionally, Storybooks can be made public. These Storybooks won't show up on other dashboards, but their URL can be shared and people without accounts on Mythic can view them.

In both of these cases, people with access will be able to see all the pages in the Storybook, but not edit or delete them.

### Receiving Shares

By default, receiving shares is disabled. You will need to explicitly enable them either globally or for individual users. Go to your [Settings](https://app.mythic.nz/settings) page to configure this. You can either allow shares from everyone with certain accounts blocked, or block everyone with certain accounts allowed to share.

You can individually remove shared Storybooks on your dashboard, but it won't prevent someone from re-sharing it to you. If you disable sharing or block a user, all those shared Storybooks will be removed from your dashboard.

If you feel you are being harassed by someone via the sharing feature, or they have shared content that is against our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/), please [get in touch](/contact/).
